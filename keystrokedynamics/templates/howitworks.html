  <h2>What is Keystroke Dynamics?</h2>
  <h5>The behavioral biometric of Keystroke Dynamics uses the manner and
    rhythm in which an individual types characters on a keyboard or keypad.
    The keystroke rhythms of a user are measured to develop a unique biometric
    template of the user's typing pattern for future authentication.
    Raw measurements available from almost every keyboard can be recorded
    to determine Dwell time (the time a key pressed) and Flight time (the
    time between "key up" and the next "key down"). The recorded keystroke
    timing data is then processed through a unique neural algorithm, which
    determines a primary pattern for future comparison. Similarly,
    vibration information may be used to create a pattern for future use
    in both identification and authentication tasks.

  </h5>
  <h2>How it works?</h2>
  <h5>
    Keystroke dynamics analysis is fairly fast growing direction of research
    that is due to need to ensure the security of a large park of applications
    and adaptation to the changing technologies. In this project we proposed
    keystroke dynamics user authentication method which uses (modified) method
    of digraphs.

  <h5>In this case, it suggested the division of the keyboard keys on their
  functional purpose. Each zone generates its own events (double and single)
  which are analyzed separately. The final decision of authentication is made
  on the basis of all the data from all functional areas of the keyboard.

  For paired keyboard events is used   time parameters of digraphs(dwell and
  flight time). This makes it possible to analyze  keystroke rhythms of a user.

  This integrated approach allows to improve the accuracy of authentication
   using keystroke dynamics without increasing the volume of data being processed.
